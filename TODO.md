## Remaining Tasks 📝

### High Priority 🔴
1. **Fix Complex Circuit Issues**
   - [ ] Debug and fix the range check issues in encoding constraints
   - [ ] Resolve witness value conflicts in full aggregator
   - [ ] Ensure proper field element bounds in all circuit operations

2. **Complete Integration Testing**
   - [ ] Create end-to-end tests for aggregate signature generation and verification
   - [ ] Test with different signature counts (1, 10, 100, 1000)
   - [ ] Verify correct handling of invalid signatures

### Medium Priority 🟡
3. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Optimize circuit size for better proof generation performance
   - [ ] Implement parallel proof generation for multiple signatures
   - [ ] Add caching for frequently used circuit components

4. **Error Handling Enhancement**
   - [ ] Add detailed error messages for circuit construction failures
   - [ ] Implement proper validation for input parameters
   - [ ] Add recovery mechanisms for partial failures

### Low Priority 🟢
5. **Benchmarking**
   - [ ] Create benchmarks comparing SHA-256 vs Poseidon2 performance
   - [ ] Measure proof generation time vs number of signatures
   - [ ] Compare circuit sizes for different encoding schemes
   - [ ] Benchmark memory usage during proof generation

6. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Document the aggregate signature API
   - [ ] Create usage examples for all three encoding schemes
   - [ ] Write technical documentation for circuit design
   - [ ] Add inline documentation for complex algorithms

7. **Additional Features**
   - [ ] Support for dynamic signature counts
   - [ ] Implement proof compression techniques
   - [ ] Add support for recursive proof composition
   - [ ] Create CLI tool for aggregate signature operations

## Technical Debt 🔧
- [ ] Remove unused imports and fix all compiler warnings
- [ ] Refactor duplicate code between aggregator implementations
- [ ] Improve test coverage to >90%
- [ ] Add property-based testing for encoding schemes

## Future Considerations 🚀
- Investigate alternative ZK proof systems (Halo2, Nova)
- Explore optimizations specific to Hypercube structure
- Consider GPU acceleration for proof generation
- Research batch verification optimizations

## Notes
- The current implementation uses Plonky2 with GoldilocksField (64-bit prime field)
- Poseidon2 is used as the ZK-friendly hash function
- The circuit design prioritizes correctness over optimization in this initial version
